#### Summary of Chapter One ####

Much of computational geometry performs its operations on polygons.

`A Polygon is a region of a plane bounded by a collection of line segments forming a simple closed curve`

However, that is a long sentence made up of key words that are themselves loosely or differently defined 
depending on which branch of mathematics you happen to belong to and how preceise you want to be.
I think there is lots of hidden meaning within the powerset of keywords in the sentence and the implied, 
unspoken, topics outside the sentence given, so ...

My engineering mind says a polygon is whatever data structure that makes the calculations easier.

We can also experiment with different definitions and different data structures to find out what 
suits the algorithms and real world models best.
